# Recursion

## Tasks

Design a recursive method for each of the following problems:

1. When you cut a pizza, you cut along a diameter of the pizza. Let `pizza(n)`
  be the number of slices of pizza that exist after you have made `n` cuts,
  where `n â‰¥ 1`. For example, `pizza(2) = 4` because there are four slices
  after two diagonal cuts. Write a recursive method `pizza(n)` to return the
  number of slices and verify the correctness of your method when the pizza is
  cut 4 times _(3 points)_.

2. A bunch of motorcycles and cars want to parallel park on a street. The   
  street can fit `n` motorcycles, but one car take up three motorcycle spaces.
  Let `a(n)` be the number of arrangements of cars and motorcycles on a street
  that fits n motorcycles _(7points)_.
