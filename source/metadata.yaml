  - \section*{Foreword}
  - Some of the code samples in this hand-in are in Haskell, as opposed to
    pseudocode. This is because it made for easier testing and data modeling for
    the problems. It happens to be a very expressive language that closely
    resembles mathematical functions.
  - \section*{Declaration}
  - I confirm that the submitted coursework is my own work and that all material
    attributed to others (whether published or unpublished) has been clearly
    identified and fully acknowledged and referred to original sources. I agree
    that the College has the right to submit my work to the plagiarism detection
    service. TurnitinUK for originality checks.
  - \section*{Acknowledgements}
  - I'd like to thank my partner Shannon for her continued support and
    challenges that help me grow, both professionally and personally. I would
    also like to thank all of you who also helped me get here.
